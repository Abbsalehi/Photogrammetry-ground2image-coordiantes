Image-Object Coordinate Relation Using Collinearity Equations:

Description:
Here, the assumption is that all Interior Orientation Parameters (IOP) and Exterior Orientation Parameters (EOP) are known. The goal is to use the collinearity equations to relate object coordinates to the pixel coordinates (u, v) and locate that on the image. Considering the Interior Orientation (IO), Exterior Orientation (EO) parameters and collinearity equations, Here we are writing a python code to compute the pixel coordinates (u, v) of the GCP by using its ground coordinates (X, Y, Z), and project it on the image and plot it
